# Technical descisions

All the types (`Pitch`, `Note`, `Chord`, etc.) should immutable. Any action that should return a modified instance of a type should return a new instance instead.

# Types

## Step

Represents the steps A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

```csharp
public enum Step : byte
{
    C = 0,
    D = 2,
    E = 4,
    F = 5,
    G = 7,
    A = 9,
    B = 11,
}
```

## Pitch

Represents the pitches A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and their altered versions.

We could also consider using an enum for Alter. I'm fine with either way.

```csharp
public class Pitch
{
    public Step Step { get; }
    public int Alter { get; }
}
```

## Note

A Pitch plus Octave.

```csharp
public class Note
{
    public Pitch Pitch { get; }
    public int Octave { get; }
}
```

## ChordFormula

A formula for a chord. Contains the pitches to construct a certain chord.

```csharp
public class ChordFormula
{
    public IReadOnlyList<Pitch> Pitches { get; }
    public Pitch Root { get; }
    public Pitch Lead { get; }
    public int Inversion { get; } // TODO: does this make sense?
    public string Quality { get; } // TODO: how to represent chord quality?
}
```

## Chord

A concrete chord, with notes in specific octaves.

```csharp
public class Chord
{
    public IReadOnlyList<Note> Notes { get; }
    public Note Root { get; }
    public Note Lead { get; }
    public int Inversion { get; } // TODO: does this make sense?
    public string Quality { get; } // TODO: how to represent chord quality?
}
```

## IntervalQuality

```csharp
public enum IntervalQuality : byte
{
    Perfect,
    Major,
    Minor,
    Augmented,
    Diminished
}
```

## IntervalQuantity

```csharp
public enum IntervalName : byte
{
    Unison,
    Second,
    Third,
    Fourth,
    Fifth,
    Sixth,
    Seventh,
    Octave,
    Ninth,
    Tenth,
    Eleventh,
    Twelfth,
    Thirteenth,
    Fourteenth,
    Fifteenth
}
```

## Interval

```csharp
public class Interval
{
    public IntervalQuality Quality { get; }
    public IntervalQuantity Quantity { get; }
    public int DistanceInSemitones { get; } // TODO: we might use this when transposing notes or chords
}
```

## ScaleFormula

A formula for a scale. Contains the intervals to construct a certain scale.

```csharp
public class ScaleFormula
{
    public IReadOnlyList<Interval> Intervals { get; }
    public string Name { get; }
}
```

## Scale

A concrete scale, containing the specific pitches as well as a reference to the formula used to create it.

```csharp
public class Scale
{
    public ScaleFormula Formula { get; }
    public IReadOnlyList<Pitch> Pitches { get; }
}
```
