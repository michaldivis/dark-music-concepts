# Architectural descisions

All the types (`Pitch`, `Note`, `Chord`, etc.) should immutable. Any action that should return a modified instance of a type should return a new instance instead.

# Types

- [`Step`](#Step): Represents the steps A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
- [`Pitch`](#Pitch): Represents the pitches A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and their altered versions.
- [`Note`](#Note): Represents a note (pitch + octave).
- [`PlayedNote`](#PlayedNote): Represents a note that's being played for a certain amount of time.
- [`Duration`](#Duration): Represents an amount of time.

## Pitch

A definition of a musical pitch. This doesn't contain the Octave, it should purely represent the pitches A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and their altered versions.

We could also consider using an enum for Alter. I'm fine with either way.

## Step

```csharp
public enum Step : byte
{
    C = 0,
    D = 2,
    E = 4,
    F = 5,
    G = 7,
    A = 9,
    B = 11,
}
```

```csharp
public class Pitch
{
    public Step Step { get; }
    public int Alter { get; }
}
```

## Note

A Pitch plus Octave. Represent a pitch in an absolute way.

```csharp
public class Note
{
    public Pitch Pitch { get; }
    public int Octave { get; }
}
```

## PlayedNote

I'm not too sure what to call this one, but esentially, it's a note that also has a Duration.

```csharp
public class PlayedNote
{
    public Pitch Pitch { get; }
    public int Octave { get; }
    public Duration Duration { get; }
}
```

## Duration

Not sure how to implement Duration yet. However, we already have something very similar if not identical implemented in the Units project. It's the `Time` class, which represent an amount of time in a musical way. It's based on midi ticks, which can be converted to any other musical duration like quarter notes, half notes, etc.

```csharp
public class Duration
{
    // ?
}
```

What do you think @KoHHeKT ?
